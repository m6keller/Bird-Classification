# Bird Classification Benchmarking

Benchmarking classical machine learning methods for image classification with popiular deep learning methods. The goal of this project is to explore the capabiliities of non-deep learning methods. Single regression, logistic regression, multiple regression KNN, SVM, decision trees, k-means clustering, random forests, and Naive Bayes algorithm. These methods will be compared with each other and three deep learning methods - . These models represent popular CNN methods, image transformers, and an architecture focused on decreasing CPU power.

# Dataset
Using the BIRDS [525 SPECIES- IMAGE CLASSIFICATION](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) dataset from [gpiosenka](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

# Comparison Metric
Use accuracy - just set up inference folder so that it can take this

# TODO
[] look into whether using one hot encoding works better or no
[] collect time to train and cpu/gpu necessary
[] benchmark dataset against popular image class NN and one ViT
# Later
look into using tabular data
